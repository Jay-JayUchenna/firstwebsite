    <h3>The Champions League draw takes place on Thursday at 17:00 BST in Istanbul - so what do you need to know?</h3><br>


    <p>The group stage will be played over nine midweeks this season to fit in the World Cup.</p>
    <p>So who is in it, who is going to win it, how does it work and how has the Russian invasion of<br> 
    Ukraine affected things?</p><br>

    <h2>How does the draw work?</h2>

    <p>The Champions League takes the same format as always, with four English teams - Manchester<br>
         City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham - going straight into the group stage. Celtic are also in<br>
          the group stage.</p>

          <p>The eight top seeds are the champions of each of Europe's top leagues plus the Europa League<br>
           winners - Real Madrid, Eintracht Frankfurt, Manchester City, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain,<br> 
           Porto and Ajax.</p>

           The other pots will not be decided until Wednesday's final three qualifiers between PSV and<br>
            Rangers, Dinamo Zagreb and Bodo/Glimt, and Trabzonspor and Copenhagen.

            <hr>
            <p>Uefa has to fit the Champions League group stage into a smaller period of time because of the<br>
                 Qatar World Cup.</p>

            <p>The group stage starts on 6 September and runs to 2 November - a period of nine weeks<br>
            (compared to 12 weeks normally).</p>

            <p>Usually it runs until the second week of December - but the World Cup kicks off on 20 November.</p>

            <p>There will only be three weeks without Champions League games between the groups starting<br>
             and ending. Two of those land during the September international break - and the other in mid-<br>
             October has a full round of midweek Premier League games.</p>

             <p>The knockout stages will be later than usual. The last-16 ties will be played over a month from 14<br>
             February to 15 March. The quarter-finals are in April and the semis in May.</p>

             <p>The final is at Istanbul's Ataturk Olympic Stadium on 10 June 2023.</p>

             <p>It was initially meant to be the venue for the 2020 final, and then the 2021 showpiece, but both<br>
             finals were moved to Portugal because of Covid restrictions.</p>
